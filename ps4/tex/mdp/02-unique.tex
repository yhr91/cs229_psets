\item \points{5} We say that $V$ is a {\bf fixed point} of $B$ if
$B(V) = V$. Using the fact that the Bellman update operator is a
$\gamma$-contraction in the max-norm, prove that $B$ has at most
one fixed point---i.e., that there is at most one solution to the
Bellman equations.  You may assume that $B$ has at least one fixed
point.
