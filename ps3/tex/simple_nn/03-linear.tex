\item \subquestionpoints{10} Let the activation functions for $h_1, h_2, h_3$ be the linear function $f(x) = x$ and the activation function for $o$ be the same step function as before.

Is it possible to have a set of weights that allow the neural network to classify this dataset with 100\% accuracy?

If you believe it's possible, please implement your approach by completing the \texttt{optimal\_linear\_weights} method in \texttt{src/simple\_nn/simple\_nn.py} and including the corresponding \texttt{linear\_weights.pdf} plot showing perfect prediction in your writeup.

If it is not possible, please explain your reasoning in the writeup.

\textbf{Hint:} The hints from the previous sub-question might or might not apply.
